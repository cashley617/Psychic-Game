# Psychic-Game

This project is Word-Guess-Game. The application generates random "beer-words" and the player guesses letters for eventually complete the entire word. 

The game automatically starts when the page loads, and users are instructed to use their keyboard to guess letters. 

The page shows you letters you have already guessed, remaining attempts, and tracks the number of times you win. 

I am not maintaining the project, and there are no expected updates to be made.
